# Sunspots Number Prediction Capstone
Capstone project for the Master's degree in Machine Learning and Data Science - Comparative Analysis of Sunspot Number Predictions with Machine Learning Models 

## Project Overview

This capstone project involves a comprehensive analysis of a time series dataset, utilizing both traditional time series forecasting techniques and machine learning models. The project is organized into three primary notebooks:

1. **Basic Time Series Analysis and SARIMA Predictions plus LSTM Prediction**: Capstone_Sunspot_Time_Series_NN
2. **Machine Learning Models for SNN Predictions** : Capstone_MachineLearning_Part
3. **Feature Engineering and Enhanced ML Model Performance** : Capstone_Feature_Engineering_Kp

Each notebook builds on the previous one, offering a thorough exploration of time series forecasting, starting with basic analysis and evolving into advanced machine learning techniques with feature engineering.

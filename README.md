# Sunspots Number Prediction Capstone
Capstone project for the Master's degree in Machine Learning and Data Science - Comparative Analysis of Sunspot Number Predictions with Machine Learning Models 

## Project Overview

This capstone project involves a comprehensive analysis of a time series dataset, utilizing both traditional time series forecasting techniques and machine learning models. The project is organized into three primary notebooks:

1. **Basic Time Series Analysis and SARIMA Predictions plus LSTM Prediction**: Capstone_Sunspot_Time_Series_NN
2. **Machine Learning Models for SNN Predictions** : Capstone_MachineLearning_Part
3. **Feature Engineering and Enhanced ML Model Performance** : Capstone_Feature_Engineering_Kp

Each notebook can be executed independently, providing different insites.

#Dataset
The datasets used in this project are included in the repository. You can find them in the datasets folder.
**Running on Colab:**
If you're running the notebooks in Google Colab, you'll need to upload the datasets to your Google Drive and modify the file paths accordingly.
Run the cells sequentially.

**Running Locally:**

Ensure the datasets are stored in the datasets folder within the project directory.
Modify the file paths in the notebooks to point to the local datasets.
Run the cells sequentially.
